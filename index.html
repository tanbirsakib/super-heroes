            <h1>The mighty <span class="thor-name">THOR ODINSON</span></h1>
            <p>The son of Odin uses his mighty abilities as the God of Thunder to protect his home Asgard and planet
                Earth alike. Thor Odinson wields the power of the ancient Asgardians to fight evil throughout the Nine
                Realms and beyond.Thor is the "God of Thunder",[42] a member of the race known as the Asgardians, a
                group of humanoid beings from the pocket dimension of Asgard,[43] the Realm Eternal.[44] Thor is the son
                of Odin, the All-Father and king of Asgard.[45] He was worshiped by the humans known as Vikings and
                became part of Norse Mythology.[46] Armed with his enchanted Uru hammer Mjolnir, which helps him to
                channel his godly energies, he became the mightiest warrior in the Ten Realms. When his irresponsible
                and impetuous behavior became too much, Odin sent him to Midgard (more commonly known as Earth) as a
                disabled mortal medical student named Donald Blake, stripped of his memory. After learning humility he
                regained his memory as well as his godly powers.[47][10] Thor went on to become a champion for Midgard
                as well as one of the founding members of the Avengers; "Earth's Mightiest Heroes".</p>

            <h1>The <span class="spiderman-name">Spider Man</span></h1>
            <p>Spider-Man is a fictional superhero in the Marvel Comics and the overall main protagonist of the Marvel
                Universe. He is a character created by writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko. He first appeared in
                Amazing Fantasy #15 in August 1962. The premise was that he was an orphan being raised by his Aunt May
                and Uncle Ben as an ordinary teenager. He would deal with the normal struggles of being young as well as
                the struggles of being a costumed crime fighter. His powers were super strength, agility, the ability to
                cling to almost every surface, the ability to shoot spider-webs using a device that he invented which he
                calls "web-shooters," and reacting to danger quickly with his "spider-sense", enabling him to combat
                many foes similar to that of a spider.</p>

                <h1 class="thor-name">THOR ODINSON</h1>
                <p class="contribution">Now, as we’ll know that the endgame comprised of a qiute unexpected show
                    down regarding the war with
                    thanos where iron man blushes away what supposed to be the biggest threat not only for him & his
                    freinds but also for the entire universe off the course, as the iron man in being one of the
                    smartest avenger ever had absolutely no probs what so ever in outsmarting thanos at that moment &
                    also taking him down for good as what transpired at the end of the show or movie that’s actually not
                    quite watchable since unfortunately iron man died due to the battle with thanos & also of what he
                    had endured thus far, had impacted iron man so badly that he was not even able to respond to anyone
                    of his friends nor his wife at that moment. So therefore making iron man take his last breath &
                    slept away forever, lying helpless, defenceless & finally lifeless.</p>

                <h1 class="spiderman-name">Spiderman</h1>
                <p class="contribution">Not knowing exactly what he was up to, Spider-Man boarded the Q-ship in the
                    hopes of halting the Mad Titan's devious plans of wiping half of life in the universe. Little did he
                    know, though, that his very first mission as an Avenger would also be his last - at least for now.
                    He'll be back for a brand-new solo adventured in Spider-Man: Far From Home. But before that, we'll
                    see him return in Avengers: Endgame.</p>
